 *\brief Allocate/Retrieve unicast queue group and scheduler queue group
 *       configuration.
 *
 *\description These APIs are used to allocate/retrieve unicast or multicast
 *          queue group or a scheduler queue group configuration. Scheduler
 *          queue groups are used to implement H-QoS. The set of CoS queues
 *          are uniquely identified with a GPORT ID, which represents the base
 *          CoS queue in the set. The GPORT ID is allocated from the next
 *          available queue in group of queues for the port or specified by
 *          the  input when the OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_WITH_ID flag is set. But
 *          the  flag OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_WITH_ID is only supported for a few
 *          devices. OPENNSL_GPORT_TYPE_UCAST_QUEUE_GROUP,
 *          OPENNSL_GPORT_TYPE_MCAST_QUEUE_GROUP, or
 *          OPENNSL_GPORT_TYPE_SCHEDULER type of GPORT can be added for
 *          hierarchical queuing (see also, =opennsl_cosq_gport_attach API).
 *          Depending on the functionality physical_port parameter can have
 *          one of the following values       unicast queue group   =>
 *          OPENNSL_GPORT_MODPORT_SET()            multicast queue group =>
 *          OPENNSL_GPORT_MODPORT_SET()            scheduler queue group =>
 *          OPENNSL_GPORT_NULL
 *          When allocating a queue group the req_gport parameter direction
 *          depends on the flags. If OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_WITH_ID is specified
 *          the input direction is valid. Depending on the functionality the
 *          following macros can be used to create the req_gport.      
 *          unicast queue group   => OPENNSL_GPORT_UCAST_QUEUE_GROUP_SET()    
 *                 multicast queue group =>
 *          OPENNSL_GPORT_MCAST_QUEUE_GROUP_SET()            scheduler queue
 *          group => OPENNSL_GPORT_SCHEDULER_SET()      req_gport parameter is
 *          always updated and should be subsequently used by the user.
 *          When the OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_WITH_ID flag is set, the value
 *          provided in the gport parameter is used as the GPORT ID, otherwise
 *          a unique GPORT ID will be allocated and returned. The feature
 *          using OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_WITH_ID to allocate a queue group is only
 *          supported for a few devices.
 *          For some devices that may not have the ability to shape every port
 *          or queue, the application can control whether the gport must be
 *          allocated from a shapeable or non-shapeable area.  This can be
 *          done by specifying the flags OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_WITH_SHAPING or
 *          OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_WITHOUT_SHAPING, respectively.  If neither flag
 *          is specified, the API will allocate a gport without paying any
 *          attention to whether it would be possible to configure a shaper on
 *          such port later.
 *          When the OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_OVERLAY flag is set, it allows overlay
 *          of queues that were previously allocated.
 *          When the OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_SUBSCRIBER flag is set, scheduling for
 *          the queue group will be done locally and will not involve the
 *          central arbiter. A local gport should be added only for ports
 *          which are local to that device.
 *          When the OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_MULTIPATH flag is set, a multipath
 *          shaper gport is created. Scheduler nodes  on the same level could
 *          be added to the multipath shaper gport. The aggregated traffic
 *          from all nodes is shaped by the multipath shaper. The shaping rate
 *          of multipath shaper is controlled by calling
 *          =opennsl_cosq_gport_bandwidth_set API with the multipath shaper
 *          gport
 *          When the config.opennsl variable fabric_egress_setup=0 is set,
 *          FIFO-level egress support becomes available.  The
 *          OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_EGRESS_GROUP flag is used to enable egress
 *          group support. Egress Group gports are similar to egress child
 *          gports in all other aspects. The egress group  gport connects a
 *          number of fifos to a subport and allows access at the FIFO-level.
 *          Multiple egress groups can be connected to the same subport up to
 *          sixteen fifos. In the case of egress gports, the num_cos_levels
 *          field is used to indicate the number of fifos to be associated
 *          with that egress gport.
 *          When the OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_DESTMOD_UCAST_QUEUE_GROUP flag is set,
 *          a set of virtual queue group (DMVOQ)  is allocated.
 *          On network switch chips, When the
 *          OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_DESTMOD_UCAST_QUEUE_GROUP flag is used with the
 *          combination of OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_WITH_ID,          the value
 *          provided in gport parameters is used as the GPORT_ID.          
 *          But scheduling mode need to programmed again as per the scheduling
 *          hierarcy.  API opennsl_cosq_port_sched_set() can be used to set
 *          the scheduling mode to be Strict/WRR.
 *          When the OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_VLAN_UCAST_QUEUE_GROUP flag is set, a
 *          queue to support service based queuing is allocated
 *          When a parent node is created by using opennsl_cosq_gport_add API
 *          call by passing num_cos_levels = -1 then that node can have any
 *          number of child nodes.
 *          On the chips network switch, default schedule hierarchies are set
 *          up at SDK initialization. Default schedule hierarchy elements
 *          cannot be managed except using non-gport APIs to configure COSQs
 *          at port level. The first call to the API opennsl_cosq_gport_add
 *          will destroy the default schedule hierarchies for all of ports and
 *          traffic will not flow on those ports until new schedule
 *          hierarchies for those ports are built.
 *          On the chip network switch API opennsl_cosq_gport_add return
 *          OPENNSL_E_PARAM because of fixed hierarchy. Gport tree is created
 *          during init. On the chip network switch because of fixed hierarchy
 *          scheduler the scope of COSQ GPORT is not global but it is local to
 *          per unit. So we should not modify the MODID dynamically.
 *          Some device configuration support multiple queue groups on a
 *          physical port.

 *\description Configure a profile of WRED statistics to capture on Ingress or

 *          be OPENNSL_GPORT_TYPE_NONE. For all egress statistics, the Ingress
 *          queue group gport must be set to OPENNSL_GPORT_TYPE_NONE. To set
 *          up a profile to generate Egress physical statistics,  set gport
 *          type to OPENNSL_GPORT_TYPE_EGRESS_MODPORT. For Egress subport
 *          statistics,  use OPENNSL_GPORT_TYPE_EGRESS_CHILD. For specific
 *          FIFO-based statistics, use OPENNSL_GPORT_TYPE_EGRESS_GROUP. When
 *          creating a profile for FIFO-based statistics, the CoSQ field
 *          represents the specific FIFO number.
 *          The OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_STATS_SHARED flag is used to save resources
 *          by sharing common profiles over different queue ranges. This is
 *          the most common scenario. For example,  a profile that captures
 *          all green, yellow, and red accepted packets over a specific queue
 *          range can share the same resources. However, should a user wish to
 *          simultaneously capture red dropped packets over the same queue
 *          range, then the SHARED flag would not be used and a separate
 *          buffer will be allocated to store the dropped red packets over the
 *          queue range.
 *          The minimum granularity for a data collection is 1024 counters.
 *          When allocating counters for ingress queue groups, for example,
 *          creating a profile for base queue 16 will enable statistics
 *          gathering on all queues between 0 and 1023, because of the minimum
 *          granularity. The next queue group begins at 1024. To allocate a
 *          profile to collect statistics for 16K queues, the user only need
 *          execute this command 16 times. .

 *\brief Allocate/Retrieve unicast queue group and scheduler queue group
 *       configuration.
 *
 *\description These APIs are used to allocate/retrieve unicast or multicast
 *          queue group or a scheduler queue group configuration. Scheduler
 *          queue groups are used to implement H-QoS. The set of CoS queues
 *          are uniquely identified with a GPORT ID, which represents the base
 *          CoS queue in the set. The GPORT ID is allocated from the next
 *          available queue in group of queues for the port or specified by
 *          the  input when the OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_WITH_ID flag is set. But
 *          the  flag OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_WITH_ID is only supported for a few
 *          devices. OPENNSL_GPORT_TYPE_UCAST_QUEUE_GROUP,
 *          OPENNSL_GPORT_TYPE_MCAST_QUEUE_GROUP, or
 *          OPENNSL_GPORT_TYPE_SCHEDULER type of GPORT can be added for
 *          hierarchical queuing (see also, =opennsl_cosq_gport_attach API).
 *          Depending on the functionality physical_port parameter can have
 *          one of the following values       unicast queue group   =>
 *          OPENNSL_GPORT_MODPORT_SET()            multicast queue group =>
 *          OPENNSL_GPORT_MODPORT_SET()            scheduler queue group =>
 *          OPENNSL_GPORT_NULL
 *          When allocating a queue group the req_gport parameter direction
 *          depends on the flags. If OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_WITH_ID is specified
 *          the input direction is valid. Depending on the functionality the
 *          following macros can be used to create the req_gport.      
 *          unicast queue group   => OPENNSL_GPORT_UCAST_QUEUE_GROUP_SET()    
 *                 multicast queue group =>
 *          OPENNSL_GPORT_MCAST_QUEUE_GROUP_SET()            scheduler queue
 *          group => OPENNSL_GPORT_SCHEDULER_SET()      req_gport parameter is
 *          always updated and should be subsequently used by the user.
 *          When the OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_WITH_ID flag is set, the value
 *          provided in the gport parameter is used as the GPORT ID, otherwise
 *          a unique GPORT ID will be allocated and returned. The feature
 *          using OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_WITH_ID to allocate a queue group is only
 *          supported for a few devices.
 *          For some devices that may not have the ability to shape every port
 *          or queue, the application can control whether the gport must be
 *          allocated from a shapeable or non-shapeable area.  This can be
 *          done by specifying the flags OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_WITH_SHAPING or
 *          OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_WITHOUT_SHAPING, respectively.  If neither flag
 *          is specified, the API will allocate a gport without paying any
 *          attention to whether it would be possible to configure a shaper on
 *          such port later.
 *          When the OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_OVERLAY flag is set, it allows overlay
 *          of queues that were previously allocated.
 *          When the OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_SUBSCRIBER flag is set, scheduling for
 *          the queue group will be done locally and will not involve the
 *          central arbiter. A local gport should be added only for ports
 *          which are local to that device.
 *          When the OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_MULTIPATH flag is set, a multipath
 *          shaper gport is created. Scheduler nodes  on the same level could
 *          be added to the multipath shaper gport. The aggregated traffic
 *          from all nodes is shaped by the multipath shaper. The shaping rate
 *          of multipath shaper is controlled by calling
 *          =opennsl_cosq_gport_bandwidth_set API with the multipath shaper
 *          gport
 *          When the config.opennsl variable fabric_egress_setup=0 is set,
 *          FIFO-level egress support becomes available.  The
 *          OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_EGRESS_GROUP flag is used to enable egress
 *          group support. Egress Group gports are similar to egress child
 *          gports in all other aspects. The egress group  gport connects a
 *          number of fifos to a subport and allows access at the FIFO-level.
 *          Multiple egress groups can be connected to the same subport up to
 *          sixteen fifos. In the case of egress gports, the num_cos_levels
 *          field is used to indicate the number of fifos to be associated
 *          with that egress gport.
 *          When the OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_DESTMOD_UCAST_QUEUE_GROUP flag is set,
 *          a set of virtual queue group (DMVOQ)  is allocated.
 *          On network switch chips, When the
 *          OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_DESTMOD_UCAST_QUEUE_GROUP flag is used with the
 *          combination of OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_WITH_ID,          the value
 *          provided in gport parameters is used as the GPORT_ID.          
 *          But scheduling mode need to programmed again as per the scheduling
 *          hierarcy.  API opennsl_cosq_port_sched_set() can be used to set
 *          the scheduling mode to be Strict/WRR.
 *          When the OPENNSL_COSQ_GPORT_VLAN_UCAST_QUEUE_GROUP flag is set, a
 *          queue to support service based queuing is allocated
 *          When a parent node is created by using opennsl_cosq_gport_add API
 *          call by passing num_cos_levels = -1 then that node can have any
 *          number of child nodes.
 *          On the chips network switch, default schedule hierarchies are set
 *          up at SDK initialization. Default schedule hierarchy elements
 *          cannot be managed except using non-gport APIs to configure COSQs
 *          at port level. The first call to the API opennsl_cosq_gport_add
 *          will destroy the default schedule hierarchies for all of ports and
 *          traffic will not flow on those ports until new schedule
 *          hierarchies for those ports are built.
 *          On the chip network switch API opennsl_cosq_gport_add return
 *          OPENNSL_E_PARAM because of fixed hierarchy. Gport tree is created

 *          scheduler the scope of COSQ GPORT is not global but it is local to
