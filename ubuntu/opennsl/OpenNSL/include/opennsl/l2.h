 *          operation. For switch family II and switch family I chips, mcast
 *          L2 entries associated with a VLAN ID and a destination trunk  are
 *          removed if OPENNSL_L2_DELETE_STATIC flag is used.  Conversely, for
 *          switch family III chips, mcast L2 entries associated with a VLAN
 *          ID  and a destination trunk are not removed if
 *          OPENNSL_L2_DELETE_STATIC flag is used.
 *          On switch family III devices which support an L2 pending cache
 *          (see =opennsl_port_learn_set), pending entries can be removed if
 *          the OPENNSL_L2_DELETE_PENDING flags is used. For quick deletions
 *          and optimum performance OPENNSL_L2_DELETE_NO_CALLBACKS should be
 *          used.  By setting this flag, no registered callbacks will be
 *          called during L2 entry deletions.
 *          If users want to know which entries are deleted, they should
 *          register  callback routines by API opennsl_l2_addr_register(). If
 *          L2_MOD_FIFO is used,  but the thread opennslL2MOD.x is stopped,
 *          users can not know which entries are deleted, even though they
 *          already had registered callback routines and  use this API without
 *          OPENNSL_L2_DELETE_NO_CALLBACKS.

 *\brief Add an entry to L2 Station table.
 *
 *\description Use this API to create an entry in hardware for lookup based on
 *          MAC destination address and VLAN ID. For element-encapsulated
 *          packets, ingress port is used as an endpoint during lookup. To
 *          create an entry with a desired ID, set the ID value in station_id
 *          parameter and set the OPENNSL_L2_STATION_WITH_ID flag bit in flags
 *          structure member variable. If OPENNSL_L2_STATION_WITH_ID flag is
 *          not set, API internally generates an ID and returns this value in
 *          station_id parameter.
 *          The packet termination settings for an entry are specified in the
 *          flags structure member variable.
 *          OPENNSL_L2_STATION_IPV4/IPV6/ARP_RARP/MPLS/MIM/TRILL/FCOE and
 *          OPENNSL_L2_STATION_OAM are allowed termination settings. But
 *          actual support depends on the device capability. OPENNSL_E_UNAVAIL
 *          error will be returned if a device does not support a termination
 *          option.
 *          The entries in TCAM are ordered based on priority value specified
 *          during entry create process. Default priority value is zero after
 *          initializing station variable with opennsl_l2_station_t_init()
 *          API. Application can specify a value different from the default
 *          priority value to manage the order of entries in TCAM. When there
 *          are multiple matches for a packet in TCAM, then termination
 *          settings from the highest priority rule will take effect. So,
 *          application must intelligently manage entries that have same data
 *          value but different mask values.
